<br> Welcome to kqx!<br><br>
The idea behind this blog is to share what we find during CTFs or our free time. <br>
Most of the post will be on **kernel hacking** or nerdy stuff on **x86**. <br> Sometimes we cook novel techniques and sometimes we break stuff a bit too much. <br>
<br>
Hopefully you'll enjoy the posts!
